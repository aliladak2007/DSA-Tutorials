# DSA Tutorials

This repository contains my coursework, assignments, and practice materials for the **IN2002: Data Structures and Algorithms** module at **City, University of London**.

The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and maintain organised solutions to weekly exercises, lab tasks, and tutorial problems.
